# pressing_barcelona

This code will be looking at how Barcelona's pressing approach has changed over the last 10, or more seasons, with the latest being 2018/19. In key matches, I will look at some of the more precise events around pressing. 

Equally I will be exploring how teams have succesfully played against Barcelona. This will include looking at fixtures vs:
- Malaga
- Levante
- Bayern Munich
- Man City
- Real Madrid
- Liverpool
- Roma
